HardwareMonitor is a program designed to evaluate the system it's running on (CPU, GPU, Motherboard, Fans) and provide suggestions about whether you should get better cooling.
That being said, in its current state, it doesn't really do anything beyond that. I'm hoping to fix that in the future.

To run: Open it in Visual Studio and click Run. 
Requirements: HM only supports Windows at the moment, and is reliant on information from WMI, so I don't think it would work on a Mac or Linux, even on a virtual machine.

Oh, and patience.
HardwareMonitor is currently in a state which I would hesitate to even call alpha. Some things might be finicky, some might not work at all. 
Just understand that this is not a polished product, nor is it meant to be.
